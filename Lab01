1. Create a directory named `DirA`: mkdir DirA
2. Create a directory named `Dir B`:mkdir "Dir B"
3. Go into `DirA`:cd DirA
4. Go into `Dir B` from `DirA`: cd "../Dir B"
5. Return to your user's home directory: cd~
6. Create a file named `test.txt`:New-Item test.txt
7. Move the file named `test.txt` into `DirA`: Move-Item test.txt DirA
8. Contents of `test.txt`: notepad.exe DirA\test.txt
``` 
Put your words here
```
9. Make a copy of `test.txt` named `copy.txt` in `DirA`: Copy-item DirA\test.txt
10. View the contents of `DirA`: Get-ChildItem DirA
11. Make a copy of `test.txt` in `Dir B` named `fodder.txt`: Copy-Item DirA\test.txt "Dir B\fodder.txt"
